14,Deja Kørdei,"you can tell this company genuinely loves Chung Ha.

17,N,Some kpop stylists(e.g red velvet) should learn from Chungha's outfits which are the hardwork of her stylists. Let's keep in mind that Red velvet is from SM ENTERTAINMENT which is the biggest company in SK while chungha comes from a small company. The difference in the efforts of the company on the presentation of their idols is baffling.
