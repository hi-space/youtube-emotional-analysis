8,Jeongmo,"After their destiny in queendom, I became a new fan of oh my girl"
9,Kitsune Sama,"Other girl groups: We're the best at magical dreamy concept
OH MY GIRL: Hold my fairy dust"
10,Secret BxT,"I personally think that Oh My Girl is one of the rare groups out there which is very fair, no matter line, screen time, center, and literally everything. Even the person who gets the least lines will get the killing parts. There is no members out shadow another and shine by herself. And I love how we can clearly know which position they are in the group. Seunghee and Hyojung as the main vocal who take turns in belting high notes or harmonies, Binnie as the lead vocal and still gets very decent lines despite having two main vocals above her.  YooA the main dancer doing her best in every formation, while Mimi still does not left behind as the second main dancer and a fantastic main rapper. Not forgetting Jiho as the beautiful center with very strong stage presence, and lastly our maknae Arin as the visual."
11,아리,진짜 이 그룹은 전설로 남을듯..
12,이명신,"my fifth season 
1 spring
2 summer
3 fall"
13,yamatonadeshiko_yoojy,"I've been addicted to their latest track Nonstop so I decided to check on their older tracks to at least have a more idea of their musical style. Visual and music wise, this has a magical yet mysterious feel to it. It sounds like it can be an ending theme to a magic girl, shoujo or mermaid anime. It's a compliment btw, since I am also a jpop and anime music fan."
14,Nasrul Zaffrey,"The fifth season
S = Spring
S = Summer
F = Fall"
15,rania mouj,Unpopular opinion : the best dreamy song ever
16,luviesoo,"Some people will prefer Twice, Red Velvet or Blackpink, but for me it will be Oh My Girl forever.
I could not describe all the love I have for them but I still decided to write this text to open the eyes of a few people.
Oh My Girl work very hard! They do everything they can to make their fans smile! These girls are like angels. How is it possible that masterpieces like Closer or Windy Day received no Wins? So I'm just going to say it again: Stop sleeping on them. People know Oh My Girl but don't go any further."
17,I AM BLACKPINK'S BODYGUARD,OH MY GIRL WILL COMEBACK THIS APRIL 27 IT'S A MINI ALBUM CALLED NONSTOP PLEASE SUPPORT THEM
18,Garlic Onion,"I'm proud that these girls are having more views now. I'm a fan ever since Cupid era and stop getting update from them during remember me era coz I'm being hooked up by japanese idols. Getting back here and Wow this is so great. Closer still the best tho, coz JinE still there."
19,pricelesssuga,Its crazy how I cannot choose my fav era because each era is just special and unique Im having OMG marathon btw
